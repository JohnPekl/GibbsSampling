# Gibbs Sampling

Python package for an efficient algorithm for truncating the GLMB filtering density based on Gibbs sampling. 
The implementation is done in C++ and based on __Algorithm 1. Gibbs__ (and _"Algorithm 1a"_) of the following paper.

_Vo, Ba-Ngu, Ba-Tuong Vo, and Hung Gia Hoang. "An efficient implementation of the generalized labeled multi-Bernoulli filter." IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing 65, no. 8 (2016): 1975-1987._
